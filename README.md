# Data Scientist - Code Challenge Submission

#### Results:

372.49 MAE

#### Deliverables:

- Data Exploration and Data Cleaning.ipynb:

    Contains code used to explore and clean the data, will generate csv file "Cleaned data.csv".

- Model Selection and Tuning.ipynb:

    Contains code used to select a model and hyperparameter tuning.

- Cleaned Dataset.csv:

    Generated from notebook Data Exploration and Data Cleaning.ipynb, cleaned dataset from Sample Dataset.

- main.py:

    Main code containing the final selected model and will print predicted demand for a chosen day in 2020 July and August.

- requirements.txt:

    Libraries used in main.py.

#### Usage:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install all required libraries ```pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt```
3. Run the main python file ```python main.py```
4. Enter day and month for demand forecast.
5. Predictions will be generated.
